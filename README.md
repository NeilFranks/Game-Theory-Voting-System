# Game-Theory-Voting-System

Python implementation of the paper [An Optimal Single-Winner Preferential Voting System Based on
Game Theory](https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/meetings/mathofranking/ref/rivest.pdf) by Rivest and Shen.

## Setup

(_It is suggested to work in a virtual environment)_

Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` should install everything you need in order to run the code.

## Running simulations

To simulate elections, you can either run `simulate_election.py` directly, or run `./simulate_election.sh`

The command `./simulate_election.sh` takes arguments:

- arg1: `path_to_ballot_profile` (default: `"ballot_profiles/example_from_paper.txt"`)
- arg2: `number_of_simulations` (default: `100`)

The script will simulate an election on a ballot profile `number_of_simulations` times. It is expected that IRV and GT voting systems will be the only ones where the same candidate may not win every simulation. This is due to GT's use of random selection based on probabilities from the computed optimal mixed strategy, and the IRV implementation's use of random selection in the case of ties.

To replicate the simple example from the paper, you can simply run `./simulate_election.sh`

To replicate the Schulze example from the paper, you can run `./simulate_election.sh ballot_profiles/Schulze_test.txt`

To see what happens in the case of a four-way tie, you can run `./simulate_election.sh ballot_profiles/tie.txt`

To see how candidates from the 2020 Iowa democratic caucus might fare under different voting systems, you can run `./simulate_election.sh ballot_profiles/Iowa_caucus.txt`

---

The main experiment of the paper simulates elections on 10,000 randomized ballot profiles, and enumerates the cumulative margin by which the voters prefer the outcome of one voting system versus another. To replicate this experiment, you can run `./experiment.sh`, which produces the table `cumulative_margins_table.csv`.
